open-{directory,text-file}
---
I don't use a lot of graphical programs, but xdg-open (the Linux "open this file" system) tries to open stuff anyway. This provides sane defaults for those of us that like the command line.

- open-directory opens a directory in a new xterm window (in the default shell)
- edit-text-file opens a text file in your default terminal text editor (as specified in $EDITOR, or defaulting to something sane)

Install (as default program):

    # Do not run these as root, or they will only set the default program for root
    make open-directory-install
    make open-text-file-install

Usage:

    open-directory /usr/bin
    open-text-file README

For amusement, my previous system defaults:

- text files started WINE, then got opened in notepad
- directories open in the KATE text editor

passgen

![pompompom screenshot](pompompom.png)
![pompompom screenshot](pompompom2.png)

power-beeps
---
Makes beep sounds to let you know your power cord is unplugged, or your battery is running low. Designed to be run as a daemon.

The main feature is a robust ability to deal with muting. It will happily play sound even if the terminal bell and X bell are off, and sound is muted.

My alarm is set to 10% and 5%, and deals with having two batteries (one of which doesn't always charge).

To use, install power-beeps.service to to /etc/systemd/system/power-beeps.service, and change the path to power-beeps accordingly.

print
---
Usage: `print FILE`

Only useful for me. Prints the file on my printer.

My version of 'lp' doesn't like image files, etc. This converts everything to the correct format using imagemagick.

print.index
---
Prints a file remotely, or prints from stdin if no file is given. Will not work in isolation, needs a remote program

prng
---

    prng file SEED [SIZE]
        prng verify file SEED [SIZE]

record-shell
---
Records all interactive shells using [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unix)). To use, add the magic line given to the top of your .bashrc (record-shell works on all shells, but the invocation line may need to be changed slightly for each shell)

Note that this can record SSH sessions, sudo session etc fine. However by default it does not include input (typed passwords etc).

Records to /var/log/console-recording/$USER/$DATE.log

retry
---
Retry a command 5 times or until it succeeds

roll
---
Rolls D&D dice.

    --same-size,    returns nonzero and prints an error message if not all files are the same length
